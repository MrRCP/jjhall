	<h1>JJ Hall Ltd, Professional Painters and Decorators </h1>
	<h2>Our aim is to offer clean, conscientious workmanship to meet all our customers' painting and decorating needs.</h2>
	<p>We have the knowledge, the manpower and the expertise to carry out a variety of work from a small domestic job such as a cloakroom through to the complete re-decoration of a fifty-two room manor house. We regularly work with specifiers and interior designers but are just as happy to work alongside the customer to ensure the end result is the right one.</p>
  <p>Our customers are usually private individuals who share our beliefs. We aim to improve their lives by:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Giving them a result which we and they are proud of, and</li>
  <li>Reducing stress for them while we're doing the work</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>JJ Hall Painting and Decorating has been achieving these objectives for over 25 years now.</h3>
